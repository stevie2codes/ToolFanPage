    <h2>Overview:</h2>

    <strong><p style="font-family: fantasy">Tool are an art-metal band, although neither half 
of that descriptor quite approximates the group’s sound. 
Combining challenging musical textures with metal’s 
ferocious gloom-and-doom mindset, Tool became one of 
the most celebrated hard rock bands of the last two
 decades, famous as much for their cutting-edge videos
  as they were for their powerfully introspective lyrics
   and the coiled menace of their songs. Considering the
    extensive amount of time between their albums, each new Tool 
    release is understandably treated as a major event by the group’s 
    large fan base.</p></strong>
