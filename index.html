    <h2>Overview:</h2>

    <strong><p class="text">Tool are an art-metal band, although neither half 
                of that descriptor quite approximates the group’s sound. 
                Combining challenging musical textures with metal’s 
                ferocious gloom-and-doom mindset, Tool became one of 
                the most celebrated hard rock bands of the last two
                decades, famous as much for their cutting-edge videos
                as they were for their powerfully introspective lyrics
                and the coiled menace of their songs. Considering the
                extensive amount of time between their albums, each new Tool 
                release is understandably treated as a major event by the group’s 
                large fan base.</p></strong>
